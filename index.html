			<p>Welcome to my site where i'll be testing some basic web design concepts and my HTML, CSS and PHP skills 
			via trial and error as well as following my lectures and tutorials/examples i found online (at W3 schools and other 
			programming websites), please use the form on the <a href="Contact.php">Contact Me</a> page to send my feedback, 
			or send me an email.

			<p>W3 schools is a great source of information on html, CSS as well as scripting and back-end code with 
			JavaScript and PHP, i am mainly using the data in the lectures and handouts given by the professor, they 
			are based on data gotten from the W3 schools website, well, i think this paragraph is large enough as is, 
			i don't want it to get <i>too</i> big.
